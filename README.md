Desktop dice rolling app that solves a couple of problems with all the die rolling apps I was able to find out there.

- Offline
- Roll any number of dice
- Dice can have any sides
- See a history of rolls
- Re-roll button on history let's you roll a new one like that
- No ads
- No weird interface - just push the button and clearly see the results
